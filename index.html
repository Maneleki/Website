            <p class="fs-5">Hi there! I'm Manel, and welcome to my personal website. </p>
            <p class="fs-5">After many years of working as a freelance in video production and realization, I got tired of the industry's lack of quality and the search for fast results. I wanted to change and focus on the software / IT industry. Since my Multimedia studies, I have a background in some JavaScript / HTML / CSS and an understanding of scripts and code, and how things kind of work. Also, in my spare time, I like to learn code (Python especially) and improve at Pentest with sites like PICOctf or TryHackMe.</p>
            <p class="fs-5">A plus of aiming to work in a team is to fulfill my social needs, since working as a freelance kind of limits me in this area. I do like to improve and discuss the results of what I am doing with teammates or colleagues since many times is a key to bringing much better quality.</p>
